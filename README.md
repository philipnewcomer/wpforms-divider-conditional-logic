# WPForms Section Divider Conditional Logic

The WPForms plugin does not support conditional logic. However, it is often useful when creating a form to show or hide section headers in addition to fields. This package will enable conditional logic functionality for Section Divider fields.

Usage:
```
composer require philipnewcomer/wpforms-divider-conditional-logic
```
